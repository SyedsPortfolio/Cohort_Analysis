# Description
Cohort Analysis is a data analysis technique used to gain insights into the behaviour and characteristics of specific groups of users or customers over time.

# Cohort Analysis Process
Cohort analysis is valuable for businesses as it allows them to understand user behaviour in a more granular and actionable way. Below is the process we can follow for the task of Cohort Analysis:

- The first step is to define the cohorts based on a specific characteristic or event. For example, in an e-commerce platform, cohorts could be defined based on the month of a userâ€™s first purchase.
- Gather relevant data for analysis.
- Determine the time intervals you want to analyze.
- Group users into cohorts based on the defined characteristic or event.
- Choose the key performance metrics you want to analyze.
- Calculate the chosen metrics for each cohort over the specified time periods.
- Create visualizations to present your findings effectively.

# The descriptive statistics provide the following insights:

- New Users: The average number of new users is around 3,418 with a standard deviation of approximately 677. The minimum and maximum new users recorded are 1,929 and 4,790, respectively.
- Returning Users: On average, there are about 1,353 returning users, with a standard deviation of around 247. The minimum and maximum are 784 and 1,766, respectively.
- Duration Day 1: The average duration on the first day is about 208 seconds with a considerable spread (standard deviation is around 65).
- Duration Day 7: The average 7-day duration is lower, around 136 seconds, with a larger standard deviation of about 97. The range is from 0 to 304.
